# üìò Software Development Methodologies: Waterfall, Agile, and DevOps

---

## üåä 1. Waterfall Model

### üîπ Explanation
Waterfall is a **linear and sequential** approach to software development. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It is best suited for projects with **clearly defined and unchanging requirements**.

### üîÅ Workflow
```
1. Requirements ‚Üí 
2. Design ‚Üí 
3. Implementation ‚Üí 
4. Testing ‚Üí 
5. Deployment ‚Üí 
6. Maintenance
```

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- Easy to understand and manage.
- Clear documentation and milestones.
- Well-structured approach for small, predictable projects.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- Inflexible to changes after the process starts.
- Late testing phase leads to delayed bug detection.
- Not suitable for complex or evolving projects.

## ‚ö° 2. Agile Methodology

### üîπ Explanation
Agile is an **iterative and incremental** methodology. It emphasizes **collaboration**, **customer feedback**, and the delivery of working software in **short cycles** (sprints).

### üîÅ Workflow (Scrum-style)
```
1. Product Backlog ‚Üí 
2. Sprint Planning ‚Üí 
3. Sprint (1‚Äì4 weeks):
     - Design
     - Develop
     - Test
4. Daily Standups ‚Üí 
5. Sprint Review ‚Üí 
6. Sprint Retrospective ‚Üí 
7. Repeat (next Sprint)
```

> Each **Sprint** produces a working feature or improvement.

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- Flexible and adaptable to changes.
- Continuous customer feedback improves quality.
- Faster time-to-market with small, usable increments.
- Early issue detection due to frequent testing.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- Requires experienced teams and active collaboration.
- Can be hard to define scope and deadlines up front.
- Risk of scope creep without strong controls.

## üöÄ 3. DevOps Approach

### üîπ Explanation
DevOps is a **culture and set of practices** that unify software development (Dev) and operations (Ops). It enables **automation**, **continuous integration**, **continuous delivery**, and close collaboration across teams.

### üîÅ Workflow (CI/CD Pipeline)
```
1. Plan ‚Üí 
2. Develop ‚Üí 
3. Build ‚Üí 
4. Test ‚Üí 
5. Release ‚Üí 
6. Deploy ‚Üí 
7. Operate ‚Üí 
8. Monitor ‚Üí 
9. Feedback ‚Üí Plan
```

> DevOps supports **automation**, **monitoring**, and **rapid delivery** throughout the lifecycle.

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- Faster, more reliable software delivery.
- Automation reduces errors and manual tasks.
- Real-time monitoring and continuous feedback.
- Encourages team collaboration and shared ownership.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- Initial setup can be complex and tool-heavy.
- Cultural shift required for successful implementation.
- Needs integrated security (DevSecOps) to avoid vulnerabilities.

## üìê Phase-by-Phase Comparison Table

| Phase              | Waterfall                          | Agile                                   | DevOps                                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Requirement**     | Collected once at the beginning     | Continuously evolving via backlog        | Same as Agile; driven by user feedback loop |
| **Design**          | Done completely before development  | High-level upfront, refined in sprints   | Continuous architectural planning           |
| **Development**     | Starts after design is frozen       | Iterative within each sprint             | Continuous coding and merging (CI)          |
